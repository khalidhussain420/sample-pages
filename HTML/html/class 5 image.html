    <h1>IN HER POINT OF VIEW</h1>
            <>SHE have view about house like with BIG space around the house to form a gardend area to grow plants of flowers,fruits,and vegitables etc,. she was grown up very close to nature .fine it also good because of her passion we get good percentage of OXYGEN .for come to the buliding struture spacies entrance hall with beautyfull furniture .thats it
    <h1>MY POINT OF VIEW</h1>
            <P>I WILL agree with her ideas and coming to mine house should be with large parking place or garage because i have litte love towards cars nd bikes i was such a resposible care taker of them , going to main part the house should be more rooms  3 master bed rooms 2 chlid rooms ,1 guest room one spaces hall nd chitchen , one room for theater ,beatyfull terace with bar .come to bed rooms must be a nice balcony </P>
